# Path Planning with Finite State Machines
This repository was created as a submission for the Path Planning project of Udacity's Self Driving Car Nanodegree. The goal of the Path Planning project was to create a path planner in C++ and test it against Udacity's simulator.


## Overview
The main objective of this project was to create a C++ program which communicates with a highway simulator, sending path coordinates to drive the car under a given speed, avoid collisions and make lane changes if necessary.
